# NovaScotia Pollution Predicton  
The regulation of air toxins levels is quickly becoming one of the most important and essential tasks for the governments of almost all countries. Among the pollutant index, Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a significant one because it is a big concern to people's health when its level in the air is relatively high. PM2.5 refers to tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated.
This project attempted to apply some machine learning techniques to predict PM2.5 levels in Nova Scotia, Canada.
